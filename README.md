# Text-to-SQL-Generator
This project uses a transformer-based language model to convert natural language questions or instructions into executable SQL queries. It enables seamless interaction with databases by allowing users to write plain English instructions, which are translated into SQL automatically.
This project focuses on generating SQL queries from English instructions using a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for Text-to-SQL tasks. It’s ideal for applications like data analytics tools, chatbots, no-code BI platforms, and educational purposes.

**🚀 Features** :


✅ Converts English text into valid SQL queries

💡 Fine-tuned for database-aware generation

🧠 Based on powerful transformer models (e.g., SQLCoder)

⚙️ Optimized for performance and memory (LoRA,Peft,quantization support)

📊 Includes metrics like F1, BLEU, token accuracy, and exact match

🌐 Ready for deployment with Gradiointerface

📦 Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers

SQLCoder-7B (similar LLMs)

Gradio for the user interface 

Google Colab-compatible fine-tuning notebook
